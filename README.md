# Jarvis

An off-grid voice assistant.

Currently a work-in-progress (aren't they all?), based on the [Mycroft open voice assistant](https://mycroft.ai/) and currently crammed into a cute, old-fashione speakerphone.

As is, it is much more privacy-oriented than things like Amazon Alexa and Google...whatever they call it, but it still relies on "the cloud" for a few things.  The goal of this project is to address that to allow for completely offline use.

There are a number of projects that have laid the groundwork for this, and Mycroft themselves are working on it too, but so far I haven't found a complete "turnkey" package to do it, so I'm giving it a shot.

## TODO

* ~~Setup basic functional Mycroft installation~~
* ~~Cram this into a cool case~~
* ~~Do a better job of cramming and connect as many of the physical controls as is reasonable~~
* ~~Produce some basic documentation of what's been done so far~~
* Start reducing dependence on "the cloud"
    + STT
    + API
